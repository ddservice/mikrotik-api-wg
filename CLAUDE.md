# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repo.

## What this is

A web dashboard for managing MikroTik routers across multiple sites: Hotspot
user/session management, PPPoE room-account billing (for renting out rooms,
each with its own downstream router), DNS visit-history logging (พรบ.
คอมพิวเตอร์ มาตรา 26 compliance — domain-level only), WireGuard VPN
site-to-site connectivity, and role-based admin/co-admin/user access.

Live deployment: `api.ddserviceth.com`, VPS managed via SSH, PM2 process
manager, deployed by `git pull` + `pm2 reload`.

## Architecture

- **`server.js`** — the real backend (Express). This is the only server that
  matters; `server.py` is a legacy Python prototype, not used in production
  — don't edit it expecting it to affect the live app.
- **Dual DB layer, auto-selected by `SUPABASE_URL` env var**:
  - `db-supabase.js` — async, Postgres via `@supabase/supabase-js`, used in
    production.
  - `db.js` — sync, local JSON files under `db/`, fallback/dev mode.
  - **Every function must be implemented in both files with matching
    signatures and return shapes.** When adding a DB function or a field to
    an existing one (e.g. a new site setting), edit both files in the same
    change — it's easy to update only the Supabase one since that's what
    production runs on, but the JSON fallback will silently drift out of
    parity if you forget db.js.
- **`public/app.js` + `public/index.html`** — vanilla JS frontend, no
  framework. Page/tab controller pattern: `switchPage`, `loadPageData`,
  per-page `loadXTab` dispatchers.
- **`routeros.js`** — generic RouterOS API client (`client.exec(path, args)`
  sentence builder). `executeOnRouter(fn, siteId)` in server.js opens a
  fresh TCP connection + login per call (no pooling).
- **Background poller** — `snapshotHotspotSessions()` fans out via
  `Promise.allSettled` to `snapshotSiteSessions(site)` per site every 5
  minutes, doing hotspot-session diffing, DNS-log correlation, and
  PPPoE-session diffing in one `executeOnRouter` call per site. Per-site
  dedupe state lives in Maps keyed by `site.id`.
- **WireGuard** — VPS is the hub (`wg0`, `10.10.88.0/24`), each site is a
  peer with its own tunnel IP. RouterOS script generator + auto-registration
  callback (`/api/wireguard/callback-register`) lets a router self-register
  its public key via `/tool/fetch`, avoiding manual copy-paste.
- **`nas-backup.sh`** — pull-based backup script meant to run *on* a NAS
  (Synology/QNAP/generic) that sits on an internal-only network. It reaches
  *out* to the dashboard's public CSV export routes rather than the VPS
  reaching *in* to the NAS.

## Critical conventions

- **Always `await` DB calls.** The Supabase layer is fully async; a missing
  `await` was the root cause of a major outage this project already had
  (login/menu/dashboard silently broken). If you touch a DB call site,
  double-check the `await` is there.
- **Cache-busting**: `public/index.html` loads `app.js?v=X.0`. Bump the
  version number on every `app.js` change, or the browser (and Cloudflare,
  which sits in front of the app) may serve stale JS.
- **Thai UI strings and comments in user-facing code are intentional** —
  match the existing tone/register when adding new UI text.
- **RouterOS scripting gotcha (confirmed on RouterOS 7.2.2)**: assigning a
  `/interface/wireguard/get ...` result to a `:local` variable can silently
  produce an empty value. Build values inline in the command instead of via
  intermediate `:local` variables when generating RouterOS scripts.
- **RouterOS script re-runs**: scripts that recreate an interface must
  explicitly remove old peers/addresses first (`/interface/wireguard/peers/
  remove [find]`, `/ip/address/remove [find comment="..."]`) — RouterOS does
  not cascade-delete children when a parent interface is removed, causing
  orphaned entries to accumulate.
- **มาตรา 26 retention**: `hotspot_logs` and `dns_query_logs` have a 90-day
  auto-cleanup (compliance minimum). `pppoe_usage_logs` (billing data) is
  kept indefinitely by design — do not add auto-purge to it without asking.
- **Menu/role visibility toggles are UI-only**, not API-level enforcement —
  the actual API routes keep their own fixed `requireAuth([...])` role
  checks regardless of what the sidebar shows. Don't assume hiding a menu
  item means the underlying route is locked down.
- **PPPoE live sessions have no bytes-in/bytes-out on `/ppp/active/print`**
  (unlike `/ip/hotspot/active/print`, which does expose them natively).
  Per-session traffic only exists on the dynamic interface RouterOS creates
  for each connection, named `<pppoe-USERNAME>`. To show live upload/download
  for a PPPoE room, look that interface up in `/interface/print` and read
  `rx-byte`/`tx-byte` from there. Not yet verified against a live router —
  double-check after deploy that the interface name pattern actually matches.
- **Suspending a room for non-payment**: the standard term used in this app
  is "ระงับการใช้งาน" (Suspend), not "ล็อก"/"ปิดใช้งาน" — matches ISP/billing
  convention. Implemented via `PATCH /api/mikrotik/pppoe/users/by-name/:name/suspend`
  (body `{ suspend: true|false }`), which disables the `/ppp/secret` entry and,
  when suspending, also kicks any live session so the cutoff is immediate. If
  the same pattern is added for Hotspot users later, reuse this wording.

## Syntax-checking (no system Node available)

There is no system Node in this sandbox. Use the Playwright-bundled binary
before committing any JS change:
```
/c/Users/VirusAlert/AppData/Local/ms-playwright-go/1.57.0/node.exe -c <file>
```
Run this on every modified `.js` file (`server.js`, `db.js`,
`db-supabase.js`, `public/app.js`, etc.) — there is no test suite, so this
syntax check plus manual reasoning about call sites is the only safety net
before pushing.

## Deploy workflow

Changes are deployed by the user via SSH, not by Claude directly:
```
git pull origin main && pm2 reload ecosystem.config.js --update-env
```
`ecosystem.config.js` holds live secrets (`SUPABASE_URL`,
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `PUBLIC_APP_URL`) — never
overwrite it carelessly; if it has local edits blocking a `git pull`, that's
real prod config, not something to discard.

## Database migrations

There is no migration framework — schema changes are applied manually via
the Supabase SQL Editor. When a code change adds/needs a new column, always
give the user the exact `ALTER TABLE` SQL to run, and call out that it's
needed (a missing column fails with a Postgres schema-cache error, e.g.
`Could not find the 'x' column of 'sites' in the schema cache`).

New tables should have RLS enabled (`ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL
SECURITY;`) with no permissive policies — the backend talks to Supabase
using the service role key (bypasses RLS by design), so an RLS-enabled,
policy-free table is exactly "only the backend can touch this," matching
this app's architecture where nothing calls Supabase directly from the
browser.

## Change log

Keep this updated after every code change — newest entry on top.

- **2026-07-13** — PPPoE live-status table: fixed upload/download always
  showing 0 (see byte-counter gotcha above). Added a "ระงับการใช้งาน" (Suspend)
  button on the live-status table and a matching suspend/unlock toggle on the
  room-accounts table (`PATCH /api/mikrotik/pppoe/users/by-name/:name/suspend`).
  Added a "ห้องที่ใช้ระบบ PPPoE" count card to the Overview page. Renamed the
  "จัดการ Hotspot" menu/page title to "จัดการระบบ Hotspot ทั้งระบบ" (sidebar,
  page header, and the co-admin/user permissions matrix). No DB schema
  changes. `app.js` bumped to `v=22.0`.
